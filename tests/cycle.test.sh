# The cycle's two deterministic gates, driven through every stage on a synthetic spec.
#
#   Usage: bash tests/cycle.test.sh            # from the VULYK repo root
#
# Builds a throwaway git repo holding one spec and walks it: nothing confirmed -> approved
# -> branch -> stories closed -> blind gate verdict -> owner rejects -> owner accepts ->
# the record is committed (paperwork: still CURRENT) -> a code commit lands (STALE) -> the
# owner looks again -> READY -> --record. Each step asserts what ship-check.sh and
# human-check.sh must say. Exit 1 on the first wrong answer.
